# Using timeout Socket and system time check

This is the last resort. Michael hacked it out during our weekly meeting. 

I am writing this note to understand this solution better and summarize it. 

The idea is to have two mechanisms to ensure data reading takes within the allotted time:
 - `setSoTimeout` is called on client's socket to set the timeout for waiting to receive data so that *trickling partial data* doesn't cause delay too much
 - `check_timeout` is called to make sure reading the *complete data* doesn't take longer than allotted time

For the first mechanism, we handle `SocketTimeoutException` in the while loop in `read_by_bytes`. The while loop keeps reading bytes until `num_bytes` of data have been read. `in.read` will block until either a byte is read from the network or the socket timeout is reached.

```scala
def read_by_bytes(in: InputStream, num_bytes: Int, check_timeout: () => Unit): Array[Byte] = {
  val buffer = new Array[Byte](num_bytes)
  var bytesRead = 0
  while (bytesRead < num_bytes) {
    val result =
        try {
            in.read(buffer, bytesRead, num_bytes - bytesRead)
        } catch {
            case e: SocketTimeoutException => 0
        }
    if (result == -1) throw new RuntimeException("End of stream reached unexpectedly")
    bytesRead += result

    check_timeout()
  }
  
  buffer
}
```
At first, it wasn't clear to me why we need both mechanism: **socket timeout** and **system timeout**. Here is a detailed explanation: Imagine our data (player's guess, say 8 bytes) is trickling in through the network. Without the socket timeout, reading a single byte can take longer than the timeout we set on the task of reading the entire 8 bytes of data depending on the arbitrary length of time it takes to read a byte over the network, because `in.read` will block until at least a byte is read preventing the system timeout is checked via `check_timeout()`. 

If reading each byte takes less than 5 seconds, we are fine.

0 ---- 1 ---- 2 ---- 3 ---- 4 ---- 5 (seconds)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;&ensp; | &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;|  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; byte &emsp;&ensp;&ensp; byte  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; read &emsp;&ensp;&ensp; read
    
After 5 seconds, it times out. The result of the task is None.  

However, it might take 10 seconds to read a byte. Then we can timeout after 10 seconds even though the `timeout` value we set equals 5 seconds.

0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4 -- 5 -- 6 -- 7 -- 8 -- 9 -- 10 (seconds)    
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;byte  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;read  

After 10 seconds, it times out even though the actual timeout is 5 seconds.

The secket timeout prevents this by setting a shorter timeout (e.g. 10 miliseconds) on reading partial data over the network.

```scala
...
val client = server.accept()
    client.setSoTimeout(10)
```
and we check system timeout in the function `run_with_timeout`.
```scala
def run_with_timeout[A](task: (() => Unit) => A, timeout: Int): Option[A] = {
    val begin = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
    def check_timeout() : Unit = {
        val current = System.currentTimeMillis()
        if (current - begin > timeout) {
            throw TimeoutException()
        }
    }

    try {
        Some(task(check_timeout))
    } catch {
        case e : TimeoutException => None
    }
}
```
