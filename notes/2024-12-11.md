# Using timeout Socket and system time check

This is the last resort. Michael hacked it out during our weekly meeting. 

I am writing this note to understand this solution better and summarize it. 

The idea is to have two mechanisms to ensure data reading takes within the allotted time:
 - `setSoTimeout` is called on client's socket to set the timeout for waiting to receive data so that *trickling partial data* doesn't cause delay too much
 - `check_timeout` is called to make sure reading the *complete data* doesn't take longer than allotted time

For the first mechanism, we handle `SocketTimeoutException` in the while loop in `read_by_bytes`. The while loop keeps reading bytes until `num_bytes` of data have been read. `in.read` will block until either a byte is read from the network or the socket timeout is reached.

```scala
def read_by_bytes(in: InputStream, num_bytes: Int, check_timeout: () => Unit): Array[Byte] = {
  val buffer = new Array[Byte](num_bytes)
  var bytesRead = 0
  while (bytesRead < num_bytes) {
    val result =
        try {
            in.read(buffer, bytesRead, num_bytes - bytesRead)
        } catch {
            case e: SocketTimeoutException => 0
        }
    if (result == -1) throw new RuntimeException("End of stream reached unexpectedly")
    bytesRead += result

    check_timeout()
  }
  
  buffer
}
```
At first, it wasn't clear to me why we need both mechanism: **socket timeout** and **system timeout**. Here is a detailed explanation: Imagine our data (player's guess, say 8 bytes) is trickling in through the network. Without a socket timeout, the reading process can take longer than the timeout we set on the entire task because `in.read` will block until at least a byte is read preventing the system timeout is checked via `check_timeout()`. To talk about the worst case scenario, what if only a byte of data comes through after 2 seconds when our ultimate timeout is 5 seconds?  


```scala
def run_with_timeout[A](task: (() => Unit) => A, timeout: Int): Option[A] = {
    val begin = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
    def check_timeout() : Unit = {
        val current = System.currentTimeMillis()
        if (current - begin > timeout) {
            throw TimeoutException()
        }
    }

    try {
        Some(task(check_timeout))
    } catch {
        case e : TimeoutException => None
    }
}
```
