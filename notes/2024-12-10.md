## Problem with using the main thread for sleeping/interrupting

Let's look at the `run_with_timeout` function. We just made it possible for it to take any task and run it until time is out. The way how it puts a timeout on a task is for the main thread to spawn off a worker thread that tries to run the task and store the result in its field, which the main thread can interrupt after sleeping for `timeout` miliseconds.

```scala
def run_with_timeout[A](task: => A, timeout: Int): Option[A] =
  val runnable = Worker[A](task)
  val worker = Thread(runnable)
  worker.start() // worker thread starts running the task
  Thread.sleep(timeout) // main thread sleeps for timeout miliseconds
  worker.interrupt() // then it interrupts worker's task
  runnable.result // if task is done before worker is interrupted, result is Some(value) otherwise, None
```

I was excited to play the game with this new timeout feature. I did not know there is a problem with this worker thread solution. Can you see the problem?

The problem is the entire game is slowed down by the main thread sleeping for timeout miliseconds. For example, let's assume we put a 5 second timeout on reading player's guess and the player is quick to send their guess, say in 2 seconds. They have to wait for 3 seconds to get a response from the server because `run_with_timeout` is holding up the process!  

## adding an interrupter thread

Our approach to adding a timeout on player data reading over TCP network by using a workder thread turns out to be not very good. How can we fix it? Michael Ballantyne suggested a possible solution. We add another thread in charge of interrupting the worker. The main thread then can be free of any responsibilities other than processing data and moving on to the next stage of the game. 

Here is the worker interrupter interaction diagram, drawn by MB and revised a little bit by me.  

![worker-interrupter-lifetime](images/worker-interrupter-revised2.png)

There are two scenarios:
1. worker gets interrupted while running a task   
2. worker finishes the task before getting interrupted

These are implemented by two runnables, `Worker` and `Interrupter`, and the `join` method. 


```scala
class Worker[A](task: => A) extends Runnable {
  var result: Option[A] = None
  def run(): Unit =
    try {
      result = Some(task)
    } catch {
      case e: InterruptedException => None
    }
}

class Interrupter(time: Int, worker: Thread) extends Runnable {
  def run(): Unit =
    Thread.sleep(time)
    worker.interrupt() // if worker doesn't exists (worker completed its task before time), it has no effect
}
```

The function `run_with_timeout` creates two threads, `worker` and `interrupter`, and use them to put timeout on the task. `worker.join()` makes sure the main thread waits for either `worker` to finish the task or get interrupted. 

```scala
def run_with_timeout[A](task: => A, timeout: Int): Option[A] = {
  val runnable_worker = MyWorker[A](task)
  val worker = Thread(runnable_worker)

  val runnable_interrupter = MyInterrupter(timeout, worker) 
  val interrupter = Thread(runnable_interrupter)

  worker.start()      // 1. starts the task passed to thunk 
  interrupter.start() // 2. waits for timeout miliseconds before interrupting the workder
  worker.join()       // 3. waits for the worker to either finish or get interrupted

  runnable_worker.result
}
```

Great! Now, how do we test `run_with_timeout(task, timeout)`?

This is probably not the best way to do it, but I was able to test it by adding `Thread.sleep(time)` to the task. 

```scala
def read_by_bytes_test(in: InputStream, num_bytes: Int): Array[Byte] = {
  val buffer = new Array[Byte](num_bytes)
  var bytesRead = 0
  while (bytesRead < num_bytes) {
    Thread.sleep(5000) // added artificial delay for testing
    val result = in.read(buffer, bytesRead, num_bytes - bytesRead)
    if (result == -1) throw new RuntimeException("End of stream reached unexpectedly")
    bytesRead += result
  }
  buffer
}
```
The following test should fail since timeout is shorter than the added delay in the task.

```scala
test("run_with_timeout_test should fail") {
        val out = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
        send_data(out, TestGuess(10))
        val in = new ByteArrayInputStream(out.toByteArray)

        val data_size_in_bytes = read_by_bytes(in, 4)
        val data_size = java.nio.ByteBuffer.wrap(data_size_in_bytes).getInt
        val result = run_with_timeout[Array[Byte]](read_by_bytes_sleep(in, data_size), 2000)

        assert(result == None)
}
```

Are we done here? No... 

This worker-interrupter model solution did not seem to work. I did not know why. At first I questioned my implementation and tests. Maybe checking `result == None` does not mean the test failed since the mutable field `result` is set to `None` to begine with --- i.e., `None` could mean the worker got interrupted or it didn't do anything at all. 

It turns out that the problem wasn't my implementation nor my tests. It was the limitation in the `interrupt` method itself. 

In our tests, the process it interrupts is the current thread's sleeping. However, it does not interrupt reading data over TCP network.
