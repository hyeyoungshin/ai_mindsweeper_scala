## Using a worker thread that runs *any* task
The following worker takes `task` and calls it with `in` and `num_bytes` when its `run` function is invoked, and stores the result in its mutable field, `result`. 

The main purpose of this worker is to stop running the task when the main thread interrupts it. When interrupted, `result` will be `None`. 

The way the worker is defined now makes it not very useful because it can only be used for tasks with `(InputStrea, Int) => A` signature. It also needs `in` and `num_bytes` to run the task.

```scala
class Worker[A](task: (InputStream, Int) => A, in: InputStream, num_bytes: Int) extends Runnable {  
    var result: Option[A] = None  
    
    def run(): Unit =    
        try {      
            result = Some(task(in, num_bytes))    
        } catch {      
            case e: InterruptedException => None    
        }
}
```

How can we make it more general? This comes down to the question of defining a function signature that takes any number of arguments of any type.  
```scala
class Worker[A](task: ??? -> A, args_for_task: ???) extends Runnable {  
    var result: Option[A] = None  
    
    def run(): Unit =    
        try {      
            result = Some(task(args_for_task))    
        } catch {      
            case e: InterruptedException => None    
        }
}
```

I struggled to come up with the signature, so I asked ChatGPT. It gave a long list of solutions, but only one of them actually fit my problem criteria. The "solution" is using `Seq[Any]` and `Any*` the variadic argument.

```scala
def higherOrderFunction(func: Seq[Any] => Any, args: Any*): Any = {
  func(args)
}
```
I don't like this solution. Why? 
- A function with the type `Seq[Any] => Any` takes exactly one argument of type `Seq[Any]`.
- `(InputStream, Int) => Any` is a two-argument function and does not directly match `Seq[Any] => Any`.
- You can adapt a two-argument function to fit the `Seq[Any] => Any` type by wrapping the arguments in a sequence and unpacking them within the function using pattern matching.
- This is getting ugly.
- Moreover, it creates problems like having to deal with the `Any` return type (not readable via ujson) when we want to use the returned data.

### using a thunk
Michael Ballantyne showed me how a thunk can be used to solve this problem. VoilÃ !

I learned about thunks when I studied programming languages, but have never needed to use it in a project. A thunk is a way of deferring computations for various reasons. In our case, it's used to avoid having to give unknown `task` a type signature. How cool is that?

We use `=> T` signature for the thunk.

```scala
class Worker[A](task: => A) extends Runnable {
  var result: Option[A] = None
  def run(): Unit =
    try {
      result = Some(task)
      result = Some(f)
    } catch {
      case e: InterruptedException => None
    }
}
```

The `run_with_timeout` function then can be defined as follows:
```scala
def run_with_timeout[A](task: => A, timeout: Int): Option[A] =
  val runnable = Worker[A](task)
  val worker = Thread(runnable)
  worker.start()
  Thread.sleep(timeout)
  worker.interrupt()
  runnable.result
```
  
So when we want to put a timeout on a task like `read_by_bytes`, we just pass the function with its arguments to`run_with_timeout`.
```scala
def data = run_with_timeout(read_by_bytes(in, data_size), 3000)
```
`data` has the return type of `read_by_bytes` in this example, which we can process more easily than when it has the `Any` type.
