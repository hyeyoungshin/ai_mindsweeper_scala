# Add timeout to reading data over TCP network in Scala
Solutions we came up with and problems encountered:
1. using a worker thread that can be interrupted  
**problem a.** worker thread only runs one task -- too narrowly defined

2. using a worker thread that runs any function   
**problem a.** What should be the signature of the function?  
**problem b.** Main thread sleeping delays the entire game  

3. using a worker and interrupter threads  
**problem a.** interrupt does not interrupt!

4. using timeout on Socket and checking timeout via system time  
A little Hacky, but works!

In our TCP server-client model of the number guessing game in Scala, I wanted to put a timeout on receiving player's guess via `read_by_bytes`. This helps game flow by not getting stuck by waiting on player's input.



## Using a Worker thread
The idea is to design a function that takes two arguments, `task` and `timeout`. The function, which we call `run_with_timeout`, will use a worker thread to run the task, `read_by_bytes`, and the main thread will interrupt the worker after sleeping for `timeout` milliseconds.

```scala

def run_with_timeout[A](task: (InputStream, Int) => A, timeout: Int)(in: InputStream, num_bytes: Int): Option[A] =
    val runnable = Worker[A](task, in, num_bytes)

    val worker = Thread(runnable)

    worker.start()
    Thread.sleep(timeout)
    worker.interrupt()

    runnable.result
```

`Worker` is defined as follows:

```scala

class Worker[A](task: (InputStream, Int) => A, in: InputStream, num_bytes: Int) extends Runnable {  
    var result: Option[A] = None  
    
    def run(): Unit =    
        try {      
            result = Some(task(in, num_bytes))    
        } catch {      
            case e: InterruptedException => None    
        }
}

```


When `worker.start()` is executed `Worker`'s `run()` function runs `task`, but `task` is not any function. It is assumed to be `read_by_bytes` which has the signature `(InputStrea, Int) => A`. This makes `Worker` too narrowly defined. What if we want to put a timeout on other tasks?
